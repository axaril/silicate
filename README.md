## Overview

Silicate is a high-performance, cross-platform viewer and renderer for [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) files (`.procreate`). Built with Rust and powered by WebGPU, it provides both native desktop applications and a web-based viewer for read access to your Procreate artwork. Useful for archiving and preserving your digital artworks.

> **Don't have a Procreate file?** Try the included `reference.procreate` file in the repository's base directory!

## Quick Start

### 🌐 Web Viewer | [Launch](https://axaril.github.io/silicate/)

The web viewer provides instant access without installation:
- Requires a modern browser with WebAssembly and WebGPU support.
- However, it is slower than the native viewer due to single-threaded execution.
- The UI may be unresponsive during compositing.

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Chrome/Edge 113+
- Firefox 121+ (with WebGPU enabled)
- Safari 18+ (macOS Sonoma+)

### 💻 Native Viewer | [Download](https://github.com/Axaril/silicate/releases)

#### Stable Releases
Download platform-specific binaries from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Axaril/silicate/releases):
- 🪟 **Windows** - `.exe`
- 🍎 **macOS** - `.dmg` package
- 🐧 **Linux** - Binary

#### Development Builds
Get cutting-edge builds from the [CI pipeline](https://github.com/Axaril/silicate/actions/):
1. Navigate to the latest successful workflow run
2. Download `release-{your-os}` artifact
3. Extract and run

**macOS Users:**
- Unpack the `.zip` or open the `.dmg` files
- The app is not notarized, so you may need to allow it manually by either:
  - Allow the app in `System Preferences` → `Security & Privacy`
  - Remove quarantine with the Terminal `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <file_path>`

### 🖼️ Windows Explorer Thumbnails

Silicate includes a thumbnail provider for Windows Explorer ([`libs/silica-thumbs`](libs/silica-thumbs)) that shows previews of `.procreate` files in File Explorer, just like images.
- Uses the `QuickLook/Thumbnail.png` preview embedded in each file, so thumbnails appear instantly without compositing.
- Registers for the current user only, so no administrator rights are needed.

## Features
- **Native Desktop Apps**: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Web Viewer**: Modern browsers with WebGPU support
- **Multi-file Support**: Load and view multiple `.procreate` files simultaneously
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file loading
- **Real-time compositing**: Fast and accurate rendering of Procreate files
  - Powered by `wgpu` for cross-platform performance
  - Live preview of layer changes
  - Supports blending modes, masks, opacity control
- **Export**: Save your Procreate files as images with multiple formats
- **Procreate-Inspired UI**: Familiar interface for Procreate users
- **Explorer Thumbnails**: Previews of `.procreate` files in Windows File Explorer

## Important Notes

### Rendering Accuracy
The renderer produces **slightly different results** compared to Procreate's native engine:
- `Saturation` and `Hue` blending modes follow Photoshop's style instead of Procreate's

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Latest stable Rust toolchain
- For native builds: Platform-specific dependencies
  - **Windows**: MSVC toolchain
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: `build-essential`

## Build Commands

### Native Builds
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Axaril/silicate.git
cd silicate

# Build native release
cargo build --release

# Run native app
cargo run --release
```

### Web Build
```bash
# Build for web (requires trunk)
cargo install trunk
trunk build --release
```

### Windows Explorer Thumbnails
```bash
# Build the thumbnail DLL and register it with Explorer for the current user
cargo xtask thumbs register

# Remove the registration
cargo xtask thumbs unregister
```

Explorer keeps the DLL loaded after showing a thumbnail, so re-registering a rebuilt DLL may fail. Add `--restart-explorer` to `register` to release it. See the [thumbnail provider README](libs/silica-thumbs/README.md) for all options.

## Procreate File Format
All `.procreate` files are **standard ZIP archives** with the following structure:

```
📦 filename.procreate (ZIP archive)
├── 📁 {UUID}/
│   └── 📄 {col}~{row}.chunk          # LZO-compressed RGBA tile data
├── 📁 QuickLook/
│   └── 🖼️ Thumbnail.png              # Low-quality preview
├── 📁 video/
│   └── 📁 segments/
│       └── 🎬 segment-X.mp4          # Timelapse video segments
└── 📄 Document.archive               # NSKeyedArchive with layer metadata
```

### Component Details

#### Layer Data (`{UUID}/` folders)
- Each layer has a unique UUID
- Contains **chunked raster data** in `{col}~{row}.chunk` files
- **Compression**: LZO or LZ4
- **Format**: Premultiplied RGBA or Grayscale (masks)
- **Tile Size**: `tile_size × tile_size` pixels per chunk
- Chunks are recombined to reconstruct the full layer

#### QuickLook
- `Thumbnail.png`: Low-resolution preview generated by Procreate
- Used for file browser previews on iOS/macOS, and by Silicate's Windows Explorer thumbnail provider

#### Video Segments
- Timelapse recording of the drawing process
- Split into multiple MP4 segments
- Not currently utilized by Silicate

#### Document.archive (NSKeyedArchive)

Apple's serialization format for Objective-C/Swift objects. Structure:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `version` | Archive format version (not used) |
| `archiver` | Archiver identifier (not used) |
| `top` | Root object reference (SilicaDocument) |
| `objects` | Object pool containing all serialized values |

**Key-Value Structure:**
- Keys are simple strings
- Values are often `id` indices pointing to objects in the `objects` array
- Contains layer hierarchy, canvas size, document settings, etc.

**Important Fields:**
- Layer information (hierarchy, names, UUIDs)
- Canvas dimensions
- Document metadata
- Layer properties (opacity, blend mode, visibility)
